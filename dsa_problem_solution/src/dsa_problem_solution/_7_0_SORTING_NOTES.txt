Arrays.sort -> we sort char int long using dual quick sort - string Integer and objects usings merege sort
collection.sort -> merege sort
//collection include non-primitive data types

stablity in algorithm :
If our data is integer then we don't need stablity, its fine with unstable algorithm also. If we are working with 
objects we must need stablity because many fields are there with numerical data.
eg for stable algorithm : bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort ... 
eg for unstable algorithm : selection sort, quick sort, heap sort ...
