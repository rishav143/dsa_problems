if array is already sorted then quick sort will always goes into worst case. This is called adversary analysis.
the solution of this problem is we can take random number and swap it will left or right according to partition
algorithm.

p = random(l, r)
swap(arr[l], arr[p]) -> hoare partition
swap(arr[r], arr[p]) -> lomuto partition
